# Authentication Implementation Guide for Scripture Voice

## Implementation Checklist

This guide will help you implement the authentication flow in your Scripture Voice app step by step. Follow these steps in order to get everything working properly.

### Step 1: Create Necessary Directories

First, make sure you have the right directory structure in your project:

```
app/src/main/java/com/example/scripturevoice/
├── data/
│   ├── model/
│   ├── repository/
│   ├── Resource.kt
│   └── SessionManager.kt
├── di/
│   └── AppModule.kt
├── ui/
│   ├── auth/
│   │   ├── LoginFragment.kt
│   │   ├── RegisterFragment.kt
│   │   ├── VerificationFragment.kt
│   │   └── AuthViewModel.kt
│   ├── base/
│   │   ├── BaseActivity.kt
│   │   └── BaseFragment.kt
│   ├── MainViewModel.kt
│   └── RoomControlsFragment.kt
├── MainActivity.kt
└── ScriptureVoiceApp.kt
```

### Step 2: Add Layout Files

Add the new layout files to your resources:

1. Create `fragment_login.xml` in `res/layout/`
2. Create `fragment_register.xml` in `res/layout/`
3. Create `fragment_verification.xml` in `res/layout/`
4. Update `fragment_room_controls.xml` to include the logout button

### Step 3: Update Navigation Graph

Update the `nav_graph.xml` file in `res/navigation/` to include all the actions and fragments.

### Step 4: Update String Resources

Update your `strings.xml` file in `res/values/` to include all the new string resources.

### Step 5: Create Data Models and Repositories

1. Create the `User.kt` model in the `data/model/` directory
2. Create `SessionManager.kt` in the `data/` directory
3. Create `UserRepository.kt` in the `data/repository/` directory

### Step 6: Create ViewModels and Fragments

1. Create `AuthViewModel.kt` in the `ui/auth/` directory
2. Create the following fragments in the `ui/auth/` directory:
   - `LoginFragment.kt`
   - `RegisterFragment.kt`
   - `VerificationFragment.kt`

### Step 7: Update Existing Classes

1. Update `AppModule.kt` to provide the new dependencies
2. Update `MainActivity.kt` to handle the navigation
3. Update `RoomControlsFragment.kt` to add logout functionality

### Step 8: Add Safe Args Plugin

Follow the instructions in the Safe Args Configuration Guide to add the Safe Args plugin to your project.

## Testing Your Implementation

To test your implementation, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Firebase properly set up in your project
2. Run the app and verify that you're redirected to the login screen
3. Test the registration flow:
   - Create a new account
   - Verify that you're redirected to the email verification screen
   - Check that verification emails are sent
4. Test the login flow:
   - Log in with existing credentials
   - Verify that email verification is checked
   - Test the "forgot password" functionality
5. Test the logout functionality:
   - Verify that you're redirected to the login screen after logout
   - Verify that you can't access protected screens without logging in

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Firebase Authentication Issues

- Make sure you've added the correct dependencies for Firebase Authentication
- Verify that your `google-services.json` file is properly configured
- Check Firebase Console to ensure Authentication is enabled

### Navigation Issues

- Ensure that your navigation graph has all the necessary actions
- Check that you're using the correct action IDs in your code
- Verify that your fragment classes match the ones referenced in the navigation graph

### Layout Issues

- Make sure all IDs in your layout files match those referenced in your Fragments
- Check that you're using the correct ViewBinding instances

### Dependency Injection Issues

- Verify that all your dependencies are properly provided in AppModule
- Make sure your classes are properly annotated with @Inject, @Singleton, etc.
- Check that Hilt is properly set up in your application

## Next Steps

Once your authentication system is working properly, you can move on to implementing:

1. Room Management System
2. Scripture Viewing and Synchronization
3. Audio Conferencing with 100ms
4. User Profile Management
